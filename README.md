# Android-Kotlin-App

All activities connect to each other and switch seemlessly. 
First activity opens up, and passes data you enter to second activity.
Second Activity generates random amounts.
Dark/Light mode works. 
Can access Help activity from the main activity before you login.
Still was never able to update Textviews mathamatically, so there will be issues with the entire functionality.
